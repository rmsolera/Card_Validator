# Card Validator

Sample credit card validator form to add payment methods to your website. Made as a project for my web applications design course.

Supported for VISA and Mastercard and easily upgradable to other cards.

*VISA and Mastercard validations are made in Javascript. The methodology of card verification is based on regular expression.
*CVV card validation is using the most common method found on the internet only valid for CVV type 1 (El CVV se calcula tomando el octavo numero, el doceavo y el treceavo n√∫mero de la tarjeta y se le suma 1).
